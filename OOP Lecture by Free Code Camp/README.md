# OOP Lecture by Free Code Camp

Class Attributes.py made from : https://github.com/jimdevops19/PythonOOP

## Extras:
1. use `self.__class__.__name__` inside any instance method to get name of class it is from.
2. Put `__` before name of any method (eg: `def __method(self):`) to make it a private method which can be called from within the class only and can't be accessible outside the class.
3. ***Polymorphism*** ::: It refers to use of single type entity to represent different types in different scenarios.
